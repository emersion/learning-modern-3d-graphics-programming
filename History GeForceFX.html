It improved on the 8500 somewhat. The vertex
            shader gained real conditional branching logic. Some of the limits were also relaxed;
            the number of available outputs and uniforms increased. The fragment shader's
            architecture remained effectively the same; the 9700 simply increased the limits. There
            were 8 textures available and 16 opcodes, and it could perform 4 passes over this
            set.</p><p>The GeForce FX, released in 2003, was a substantial improvement, both over the GeForce
            3/4 and over the 9700 in terms of fragment processing. NVIDIA took a different approach
            to their fragment shaders; their fragment processor worked not entirely unlike modern
            shader processors do.</p><p>It read an instruction, which could be a math operation, conditional branch (they had
            actual branches in fragment shading), or texture lookup instruction. It then executed
            that instruction. The texture lookup could be from a set of 8 textures. And then it
            repeated this process on the next instruction. It was doing math computations in a way
            not entirely unlike a traditional CPU.</p><p>There was no real concept of a dependent texture access for the GeForce FX. The inputs
            to the fragment pipeline were simply the texture coordinates and colors from the vertex
            stage. If you used a texture coordinate to access a texture, it was fine with that. If
            you did some computations with them and then accessed a texture, it was just as fine
            with that. It was completely generic.</p><p>It also failed in the marketplace. This was due primarily to its lateness and its poor
            performance in high-precision computation operations. The FX was optimized for doing
            16-bit math computations in its fragment shader; while it <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> do
            32-bit math, it was half as fast when doing this. But Direct3D 9's shaders did not allow
            the user to specify the precision of computations; the specification required at least
            24-bits of precision. To match this, NVIDIA had no choice but to force 32-bit math on
            all D3D 9 applications, making them run much slower than their ATI counterparts (the
            9700 always used 24-bit precision math).</p><p>Things were no better in OpenGL land. The two competing unified fragment processing
            APIs, GLSL and an assembly-like fragment shader, did not have precision specifications
            either. Only NVIDIA's proprietary extension for fragment shaders provided that, and
            developers were less likely to use it. Especially with the head start that the 9700
            gained in the market by the FX being released late.</p><p>It performs so poorly in the market that NVIDIA dropped the FX name for the next
            hardware revision. The GeForce 6 improved its 32-bit performance to the point where it
            was competitive with the ATI equivalents.</p><p>This level of hardware saw the gaining of a number of different features. sRGB
            textures and framebuffers appeared, as did floating-point textures. Blending support for
            floating-point framebuffers was somewhat spotty; some hardware could do it only for
            16-bit floating-point, some could not do it at all. The restrictions of power-of-two
            texture sizes was also lifted, to varying degrees. None of ATI's hardware of this era
            fully supported this when used with mipmapping, but NVIDIA's hardware from the GeForce 6
            and above did.</p><p>The ability to access textures from vertex shaders was also introduced in this series
            of hardware. Vertex texture accesses uses a separate list of textures from those bound
            for fragment shaders. Only four textures could be accessed from a vertex shader, while 8
            textures was normal for fragment shaders.</p><p>Render to texture also became generally available at this time, though this was more
            of an API issue (neither OpenGL nor Direct3D allowed textures to be used as render
            targets before this point) than hardware functionality. That is not to say that hardware
            had no role to play. Textures are often not stored as linear arrays of memory the way
            they are loaded with <code class="function">glTexImage</code>. They are usually stored in a
            swizzled format, where 2D or 3D blocks of texture data are stored sequentially. Thus,
            rendering to a texture required either the ability to render directly to swizzled
            formats or the ability to read textures that are stored in unswizzled formats.</p><p>More than just render to texture was introduced. What was also introduced was the
            ability to render to multiple textures or buffers at one time. The number of renderable
            buffers was generally limited to 4 across all hardware platforms.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Rise of the Compilers</b></p><p>Microsoft put their foot down after the fiasco with D3D 8's fragment shaders. They
                wanted a single standard that all hardware makers would support. While this lead to
                the FX's performance failings, it also meant that compilers were becoming very
                important to shader performance.</p><p>In order to have a real abstraction, you need compilers that are able to take the
                abstract language and map it to very different kinds of hardware. With Direct3D and
                OpenGL providing standards for shading languages, compiler quality started to become
                vital for performance.</p><p>OpenGL moved whole-heartedly, and perhaps incautiously, into the realm of
                compilers when the OpenGL ARB embraced GLSL, a C-style language. They developed this
                language to the exclusion of all others.</p><p>In Direct3D land, Microsoft developed the High-Level Shading Language, HLSL. But
                the base shading languages used by Direct3D 9 were still the assembly-like shading
                languages. HLSL was compiled by a Microsoft-developed compiler into the assembly
                languages, which were fed to Direct3D.</p><p>With compilers and semi-real languages with actual logic constructs, a new field
                started to arise: General Programming GPU or <acronym class="acronym">GPGPU</acronym>. The idea was
                to use a GPU to do non-rendering tasks. It started around this era, but the
                applications were limited due to the nature of hardware. Only fairly recently, with
                the advent of special languages and APIs (OpenCL, for example) that are designed for
                GPGPU tasks, has GPGPU started to really move into its own. Indeed, in the most
                recent hardware era, hardware makers have added features to GPUs that have
                somewhat... dubious uses in the field of graphics, but substantial uses in GPGPU
                tasks.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="History Radeon8500.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="History of Graphics Hardware.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="History Unified.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Programming at Last&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Modern Unification</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
