All of the examples in this book are designed on and for
            this era of hardware, though some of them could run on older ones with some alteration.
            The release of the Radeon HD 2000 and GeForce 8000 series cards in 2006 represented
            unification in more ways than one.</p><p>With the prior generations, fragment hardware had certain platform-specific
            peculiarities. While the API kinks were mostly ironed out with the development of proper
            shading languages, there were still differences in the behavior of hardware. While 4
            dependent texture accesses were sufficient for most applications, naive use of shading
            languages could get you in trouble on ATI hardware.</p><p>With this generation, neither side really offered any real functionality difference.
            There are still differences between the hardware lines, and certainly in terms of
            performance. But the functionality differences have never been more blurred than they
            were with this revision.</p><p>Another form of unification was that both NVIDIA and ATI moved to a unified shader
            architecture. In all prior generations, fragment shaders and vertex shaders were
            fundamentally different hardware. Even when they started doing the same kinds of things,
            such as accessing textures, they were both using different physical hardware to do so.
            This led to some inefficiencies.</p><p>Deferred rendering probably gives the most explicit illustration of the problem. The
            first pass, the creation of the g-buffers, is a very vertex-shader-intensive activity.
            While the fragment shader can be somewhat complex, doing several texture fetches to
            compute various material parameters, the vertex shader is where much of the real work is
            done. Lots of vertices come through the shader, and if there are any complex
            transformations, they will happen here.</p><p>The second pass is a <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> fragment shader intensive pass. Each
            light layer is comprised of exactly 4 vertices. Vertices that can be provided directly
            in clip-space. From then on, the fragment shader is what is being worked. It performs
            all of the complex lighting calculations necessary for the various rendering techniques.
            Four vertices generate literally millions of fragments, depending on the rendering
            resolution.</p><p>In prior hardware generations, in the first pass, there would be fragment shaders
            going to waste, as they would process fragments faster than the vertex shaders could
            deliver triangles. In the second pass, the reverse happens, only even moreso. Four
            vertex shader executions, and then all of those vertex shaders would be completely
            useless. All of those parallel computational units would go to waste.</p><p>Both NVIDIA and ATI devised hardware such that the computational elements were
            separated from their particular kind of computations. All shader hardware could be used
            for vertices, fragments, or geometry shaders (new in this generation). This would be
            changed on demand, based on the resource load. This makes deferred rendering in
            particular much more efficient; the second pass is able to use almost all of the
            available shader resources for lighting operations.</p><p>This unified shader approach also means that every shader stage has essentially the
            same capabilities. The standard for the maximum texture count is 16, which is plenty
            enough for doing just about anything. This is applied equally to all shader types, so
            vertex shaders have the same number of textures available as fragment shaders.</p><p>This smoothed out a great many things. Shaders gained quite a few new features.
            Uniform buffers became available. Shaders could perform computations directly on integer
            values. Unlike every generation before, all of these features were parceled out to all
            types of shaders equally.</p><p>Along with unified shaders came a long list of various and sundry improvements to
            non-shader hardware. These include, but are not limited to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Floating-point blending was worked out fully. Hardware of this era supports
                    full 32-bit floating point blending, though for performance reasons you're still
                    advised to use the lowest precision you can get away with.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Arbitrary texture swizzling as a direct part of texture sampling parameters,
                    rather than in the shader itself.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Integer texture formats, to compliment the shader's ability to use integer
                    values.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Array textures.</p></li></ul></div><p>Various other limitations were expanded as well.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Post-Modern</b></p><p>This was not the end of hardware evolution; there has been hardware released in
                recent years  The Radeon HD 5000 and GeForce GT 400 series and above have increased
                rendering features. They're just not as big of a difference compared to what came
                before.</p><p>One of the biggest new feature in this hardware is tessellation, the ability to
                take triangles output from a vertex shader and split them into new triangles based
                on arbitrary (mostly) shader logic. This sounds like what geometry shaders can do,
                but it is different.</p><p>Tessellation is actually something that ATI toyed around with for years. The
                Radeon 9700 had tessellation support with something they called PN triangles. This
                was very automated and not particularly useful. The entire Radeon HD 2000-4000 cards
                included tessellation features as well. These were pre-vertex shader, while the
                current version comes post-vertex shader.</p><p>In the older form, the vertex shader would serve double duty. An incoming triangle
                would be broken down into many triangles. The vertex shader would then have to
                compute the per-vertex attributes for each of the new triangles, based on the old
                attributes and which vertex in the new series of vertices is being computed. Then it
                would do its normal transformation and other operations on those attributes.</p><p>The current form introduces two new shader stages. The first, immediately after
                the vertex shader, controls how much tessellation happens on a particular primitive.
                The tessellation happens, splitting the single primitive into multiple primitives.
                The next stage determines how to compute the new positions, normals, etc of the
                primitive, based on the values of the primitive being tessellated. The geometry
                shader still exists; it is executed after the final tessellation shader
                stage.</p><p>Another feature is the ability to have a shader arbitrarily read
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> write to images in textures. This is not merely
                sampling from a texture; it uses a different interface (no filtering), and it means
                very different things. This form of image data access breaks many of the rules
                around OpenGL, and it is very easy to use the feature wrongly.</p><p>These are not covered in this book for a few reasons. First, there is not as much
                hardware out there that supports it (though this is increasing daily). Sticking to
                OpenGL 3.3 meant casting a wider net; requiring OpenGL 4.2 would have meant fewer
                people could run those tutorials.</p><p>Second, these features are quite complicated to use. Any discussion of
                tessellation would require discussing tessellation algorithms, which are all quite
                complicated. Any discussion of image reading/writing would require talking about
                shader hardware at a level of depth that is well beyond the beginner level. These
                are useful features, to be sure, but they are also very complex features.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="History GeForceFX.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="History of Graphics Hardware.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Getting Started with OpenGL.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Dependency&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Appendix&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Getting Started with OpenGL</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
