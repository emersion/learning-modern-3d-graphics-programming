That was a simple, flat scene;
        now, we are going to introduce lighting. But before we can do that, we need to have a
        discussion about what is actually stored in the texture.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e15368"></a>The sRGB Colorspace</h2></div></div></div><p>One of the most important things you should keep in mind with textures is the answer
            to the question, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">what does the data in this texture mean?</span>&#8221;</span> In the first
            texturing tutorial, we had many textures with various meanings. We had:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>A 1D texture that represented the Gaussian model of specular reflections for a
                    specific shininess value.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A 2D texture that represented the Gaussian model of specular reflections,
                    where the S coordinate represented the angle between the normal and the
                    half-angle vector. The T coordinate is the shininess of the surface.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A 2D texture that assigned a specular shininess to each position on the
                    surface.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is vital to know what data a texture stores and what its texture coordinates mean.
            Without this knowledge, one could not effectively use those textures.</p><p>Earlier, we discussed how important colors in a linear colorspace was to getting
            accurate color reproduction in lighting and rendering. Gamma correction was applied to
            the output color, to map the linear RGB values to the gamma-correct RGB values the
            display expects.</p><p>At the time, we said that our lighting computations all assume that the colors of the
            vertices were linear RGB values. Which means that it was important that the creator of
            the model, the one who put the colors in the mesh, ensure that the colors being added
            were in fact linear RGB colors. If the modeller failed to do this, if the modeller's
            colors were in a non-linear RGB colorspace, then the mesh would come out with colors
            that were substantially different from what he expected.</p><p>The same goes for textures, only much moreso. And that is for one very important
            reason. Load up the <span class="propername">Gamma Ramp</span> tutorial.</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e15398"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;16.1.&nbsp;Gamma Ramp </b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Gamma%20Ramp.png" alt="Gamma Ramp"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>These are just two rectangles with a texture mapped to them. The top one is rendered
            without the shader's gamma correction, and the bottom one is rendered with gamma
            correction. These textures are 320x64 in size, and they are rendered at exactly this
            size.</p><p>The texture contains five greyscale color blocks. Each block increases in brightness
            from the one to its left, in 25% increments. So the second block to the left is 25% of
            maximum brightness, the middle block is 50% and so on. This means that the second block
            to the left should appear half as bright as the middle, and the middle should appear
            half as bright as the far right block.</p><p>Gamma correction exists to make linear values appear properly linear on a non-linear
            display. It corrects for the display's non-linearity. Given everything we know, the
            bottom rectangle, the one with gamma correction which takes linear values and converts
            them for proper display, should appear correct. The top rectangle should appear
            wrong.</p><p>And yet, we see the exact opposite. The relative brightness of the various blocks is
            off in the bottom block, but not the top. Why does this happen?</p><p>Because, while the apparent brightness of the texture values increases in 25%
            increments, the color values that are used by that texture do not. This texture was not
            created by simply putting 0.0 in the first block, 0.25 in the second, and so forth. It
            was created by an image editing program. The colors were selected by their
                <span class="emphasis"><em>apparent</em></span> relative brightness, not by simply adding 0.25 to the
            values.</p><p>This means that the color values have <span class="emphasis"><em>already been</em></span> gamma
            corrected. They cannot be in a linear colorspace, because the person creating the image
            selected colors based the colors on their appearance. Since the appearance of a color is
            affected by the non-linearity of the display, the texture artist was effectively
            selected post-gamma corrected color values. To put it simply, the colors in the texture
            are already in a non-linear color space.</p><p>Since the top rectangle does not use gamma correction, it is simply passing the
            pre-gamma corrected color values to the display. It simply works itself out. The bottom
            rectangle effectively performs gamma correction twice.</p><p>This is all well and good, when we are drawing a texture directly to the screen. But
            if the colors in that texture were intended to represent the diffuse reflectance of a
            surface as part of the lighting equation, then there is a major problem. The color
            values retrieved from the texture are non-linear, and all of our lighting equations
                <span class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> the input values to be linear.</p><p>We could un-gamma correct the texture values manually, either at load time or in the
            shader. But that is entirely unnecessary and wasteful. Instead, we can just tell OpenGL
            the truth: that the texture is not in a linear colorspace.</p><p>Virtually every image editing program you will ever encounter, from the almighty
            Photoshop to the humble Paint, displays colors in a non-linear colorspace. But they do
            not use just any non-linear colorspace; they have settled on a specific colorspace
            called the <em class="glossterm">sRGB colorspace.</em> So when an artist selects a shade of
            green for example, they are selecting it from the sRGB colorspace, which is
            non-linear.</p><p>How commonly used is the sRGB colorspace? It's built into every JPEG. It's used by
            virtually every video compression format and tool. It is assumed by virtual every image
            editing program. In general, if you get an image from an unknown source, it would be
            perfectly reasonable to assume the RGB values are in sRGB unless you have specific
            reason to believe otherwise.</p><p>The sRGB colorspace is an approximation of a gamma of 2.2. It is not exactly 2.2, but
            it is close enough that you can display an sRGB image to the screen without gamma
            correction. Which is exactly what we did with the top rectangle.</p><p>Because of the ubiquity of the sRGB colorspace, sRGB decoding logic is built directly
            into GPUs these days. And naturally OpenGL supports it. This is done via special image
            formats.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e15442"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;16.1.&nbsp;sRGB Image Format</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">std::auto_ptr&lt;glimg::ImageSet&gt; pImageSet(glimg::loaders::stb::LoadFromFile(filename.c_str()));

            correct bottom one is right.</p><p>When a texture uses one of the sRGB formats, texture access functions to those
            textures do things slightly differently. When they fetch a texel, OpenGL automatically
            linearizes the color from the sRGB colorspace. This is exactly what we want. And the
            best part is that the linearisation cost is negligible. So there is no need to play with
            the data or otherwise manually linearize it. OpenGL does it for us.</p><p>Note that the shader does not change. It still uses a regular <span class="type">sampler2D</span>,
            accesses it with a 2D texture coordinate and the <code class="function">texture</code> function,
            etc. The shader does not have to know or care whether the image data is in the sRGB
            colorspace or a linear one. It simply calls the <code class="function">texture</code> function
            and expects it to return lRGB color values.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e15487"></a>Pixel Positioning</h3></div></div></div><p>There is an interesting thing to note about the rendering in this tutorial. Not
                only does it use an orthographic projection (unlike most of our tutorials since
                Tutorial 4), it does something special with its orthographic projection. In the
                pre-perspective tutorials, the orthographic projection was used essentially by
                default. We were drawing vertices directly in clip-space. And since the W of those
                vertices was 1, clip-space is identical to NDC space, and we therefore had an
                orthographic projection.</p><p>It is often useful to want to draw certain objects using window-space pixel
                coordinates. This is commonly used for drawing text, but it can also be used for
                displaying images exactly as they appear in a texture, as we do here. Since a vertex
                shader must output clip-space values, the key is to develop a matrix that transforms
                window-space coordinates into clip-space. OpenGL will handle the conversion back to
                window-space internally.</p><p>This is done via the <code class="function">reshape</code> function, as with most of our
                projection matrix functions. The computation is actually quite simple.</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e15499"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;16.2.&nbsp;Window to Clip Matrix Computation</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glutil::MatrixStack persMatrix;
persMatrix.Translate(-<span class="code-number">1.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>, <span class="code-number">0.0f</span>);
persMatrix.Scale(<span class="code-number">2.0f</span> / w, -<span class="code-number">2.0f</span> / h, <span class="code-number">1.0f</span>);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>The goal is to transform window-space coordinates into clip-space, which is
                identical to NDC space since the W component remains 1.0. Window-space coordinates
                have an X range of [0, w) and Y range of [0, h). NDC space has X and Y ranges of
                [-1, 1].</p><p>The first step is to scale our two X and Y ranges from [0, w/h) to [0, 2]. The
                next step is to apply a simply offset to shift it over to the [-1, 1] range. Don't
                forget that the transforms are applied in the reverse order from how they are
                applied to the matrix stack.</p><p>There is one thing to note however. NDC space has +X going right and +Y going up.
                OpenGL's window-space agrees with this; the origin of window-space is at the
                lower-left corner. That is nice and all, but many people are used to a top-left
                origin, with +Y going down.</p><p>In this tutorial, we use a top-left origin window-space. That is why the Y scale
                is negated and why the Y offset is positive (for a lower-left origin, we would want
                a negative offset).</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>By negating the Y scale, we flip the winding order of objects rendered. This
                    is normally not a concern; most of the time you are working in window-space, you
                    aren't relying on face culling to strip out certain triangles. In this tutorial,
                    we do not even enable face culling. And oftentimes, when you are rendering with
                    pixel-accurate coordinates, face culling is irrelevant and should be
                    disabled.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e15515"></a>Vertex Formats</h3></div></div></div><p>In all of the previous tutorials, our vertex data has been arrays of
                floating-point values. For the first time, that is not the case. Since we are
                working in pixel coordinates, we want to specify vertex positions with integer pixel
                coordinates. This is what the vertex data for the two rectangles look like:</p><pre class="programlisting"><span class="code-keyword">const</span> GLushort vertexData[] = {
     <span class="code-number">90</span>, <span class="code-number">80</span>,	<span class="code-number">0</span>,     <span class="code-number">0</span>,
     <span class="code-number">90</span>, <span class="code-number">16</span>,	<span class="code-number">0</span>,     <span class="code-number">65535</span>,

    <span class="code-number">410</span>, <span class="code-number">112</span>,   <span class="code-number">65535</span>, <span class="code-number">65535</span>,
};</pre><p>Our vertex data has two attributes: position and texture coordinates. Our
                positions are 2D, as are our texture coordinates. These attributes are interleaved,
                with the position coming first. So the first two columns above are the positions and
                the second two columns are the texture coordinates.</p><p>Instead of floats, our data is composed of <span class="type">GLushort</span>s, which are
                2-byte integers. How OpenGL interprets them is specified by the parameters to
                    <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>. It can interpret them in two ways
                (technically 3, but we don't use that here):</p><div class="example"><a name="d0e15532"></a><p class="title"><b>Example&nbsp;16.3.&nbsp;Vertex Format</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="programlisting">glBindVertexArray(g_vao);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, g_dataBufferObject);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(<span class="code-number">0</span>);
glVertexAttribPointer(<span class="code-number">0</span>, <span class="code-number">2</span>, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, GL_FALSE, <span class="code-number">8</span>, (<span class="code-keyword">void</span>*)<span class="code-number">0</span>);
glEnableVertexAttribArray(<span class="code-number">5</span>);

glBindVertexArray(<span class="code-number">0</span>);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, <span class="code-number">0</span>);</pre></div></div><br class="example-break"><p>Attribute 0 is our position. We see that the type is not
                    <code class="literal">GL_FLOAT</code> but <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</code>. This
                matches the C++ type we use. But the attribute taken by the GLSL shader is a
                floating point <span class="type">vec2</span>, not an integer 2D vector (which would be
                    <span class="type">ivec2</span> in GLSL). How does OpenGL reconcile this?</p><p>It depends on the fourth parameter, which defines whether the integer value is
                normalized. If it is set to <code class="literal">GL_FALSE</code>, then it is not normalized.
                Therefore, it is converted into a float as though by standard C/C++ casting. An
                integer value of 90 is cast into a floating-point value of 90.0f. And this is
                exactly what we want.</p><p>Well, that is what we want to for the position; the texture coordinate is a
                different matter. Normalized texture coordinates should range from [0, 1] (unless we
                want to employ wrapping of some form). To accomplish this, integer texture
                coordinates are often, well, normalized. By passing <code class="literal">GL_TRUE</code> to
                the fourth parameter (which only works if the third parameter is an integer type),
                we tell OpenGL to normalize the integer value when converting it to a float.</p><p>This normalization works exactly as it does for texel value normalization. Since
                the maximum value of a <span class="type">GLushort</span> is 65535, that value is mapped to 1.0f,
                while the minimum value 0 is mapped to 0.0f. So this is just a slightly fancy way of
                setting the texture coordinates to 1 and 0.</p><p>Note that all of this conversion is <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>, in terms of
                performance. Indeed, it is often a useful performance optimization to compact vertex
                attributes as small as is reasonable. It is better in terms of both memory and
                rendering performance, since reading less data from memory takes less time.</p><p>OpenGL is just fine with using normalized shorts alongside 32-bit floats,
                normalized unsigned bytes (useful for colors), etc, all in the same vertex data
                (though not within the same <span class="emphasis"><em>attribute</em></span>). The above array could
                have use <code class="literal">GLubyte</code> for the texture coordinate, but it would have
                been difficult to write that directly into the code as a C-style array. In a real
                application, one would generally not get meshes from C-style arrays, but from
                files.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="Tut15 Glossary.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="Texturing.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="Tut16 Mipmaps and Linearity.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Glossary&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="/web/20150225192605/http://www.arcsynthesis.org/gltut/index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;sRGB and Mipmaps</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
