While
            3Dfx released competing cards, they were again behind the curve. The NVIDIA GeForce 256
            (not to be confused with the GeForce GT250, a much more modern card), released in 1999,
            provided something truly new: a vertex processing pipeline.</p><p>The OpenGL API has always defined a vertex processing pipeline (it was fixed-function
            in those days rather than shader-based). And NVIDIA implemented it in their TNT-era
            drivers on the CPU. But only with the GeForce 256 was this actually implemented in
            hardware. And NVIDIA essentially built the entire OpenGL fixed-function vertex
            processing pipeline directly into the GeForce hardware.</p><p>This was primarily a performance win. While it was important for the progress of
            hardware, a less-well-known improvement of the early GeForce hardware was more important
            to its future.</p><p>In the fragment processing pipeline, the texture environment stages were removed. In
            their place was a more powerful mechanism, what NVIDIA called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">register
                combiners.</span>&#8221;</span></p><p>The GeForce 256 provided 2 regular combiner stages. Each of these stages represented
            up to four independent opcodes that operated over the register set. The opcodes could
            result in multiple outputs, which could be written to two temporary registers.</p><p>What is interesting is that the register values are no longer limited to color values.
            Instead, they are signed values, on the range [-1, 1]; they have 9 bits of precision or
            so. While the initial color or texture values are on [0, 1], the actual opcodes
            themselves can perform operations that generate negative values. Opcodes can even
            scale/bias their inputs, which allow them to turn unsigned colors into signed
            values.</p><p>Because of this, the GeForce 256 was the first hardware to be able to do functional
            bump mapping, without hacks or tricks. A single register combiner stage could do 2
            3-vector dot-products at a time. Textures could store normals by compressing them to a
            [0, 1] range. The light direction could either be a constant or interpolated per-vertex
            in texture space.</p><p>Now granted, this still was a primitive form of bump mapping. There was no way to
            correct for texture-space values with binormals and tangents. But this was at least
            something. And it really was the first step towards programmability; it showed that
            textures could truly represent values other than colors.</p><p>There was also a single final combiner stage. This was a much more limited stage than
            the regular combiner stages. It could do a linear interpolation operation and an
            addition; this was designed specifically to implement OpenGL's fixed-function fog and
            specular computations.</p><p>The register file consisted of two temporary registers, two per-vertex colors, two
            texture colors, two uniform values, the zero register, and a few other values used for
            OpenGL fixed-function fog operations. The color and texture registers were even
            writeable, if you needed more temporaries.</p><p>There were a few other sundry additions to the hardware. Cube textures first came onto
            the scene. Combined with the right texture coordinate computations (now in hardware),
            you could have reflective surfaces much more easily. Anisotropic filtering and
            multisampling also appeared at this time. The limits were relatively small; anisotropic
            filtering was limited to 4x, while the maximum number of samples was restricted to two.
            Compressed texture formats also appeared on the scene.</p><p>What we see thus far as we take steps towards true programmability is that increased
            complexity in fragment processing starts pushing for other needs. The addition of a dot
            product allows lighting computations to take place per-fragment. But you cannot have full
            texture-space bump mapping because of the lack of a normal/binormal/tangent matrix to
            transform vectors to texture space. Cubemaps allow you to do arbitrary reflections, but
            computing reflection directions per-vertex requires interpolating reflection normals,
            which does not work very well over large polygons.</p><p>This also saw the introduction of something called a rectangle texture. This texture
            type is something of an odd duck that still remains in current day. It was a way of
            creating a texture of arbitrary size; until then, textures were limited to powers of two
            in size (though the sizes did not have to be the same). The texture coordinates for
            rectangle textures are not normalized; they were in texture space values.</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The GPU Divide</b></p><p>When NVIDIA released the GeForce 256, they coined the term <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Geometry
                    Processing Unit</span>&#8221;</span> or <acronym class="acronym">GPU</acronym>. Until this point, graphics
                chips were called exactly that: graphics chips. The term GPU was intended by NVIDIA
                to differentiate the GeForce from all of its competition, including the final cards
                from 3Dfx.</p><p>Because the term was so reminiscent to CPUs, the term took over. Every graphics
                chip is a GPU now, even ones released before the term came to exist.</p><p>In truth, the term GPU never really made much sense until the next stage, where
                the first cards with actual programmability came onto the scene.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="History TNT.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="History of Graphics Hardware.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="History Radeon8500.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Dynamite Combiners&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Programming at Last</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
